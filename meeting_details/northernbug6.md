NorthernBUG is a [Genetics Society](http://www.genetics.org.uk) meeting funded as a sectional interest group, with additional funding from **The Leeds Industry Academy** and [Leeds OMICS](http://www.leedsomics.org/).  It is a user group not a conference so the format will be a little more fluid than just presentations. The meeting will be composed of talks, discussions, and posters, but extended informal discussions of topics and challenges to all of us will be promoted.

# Detailed Agenda

Registration is from 9:30 onwards in University House (see [Location](#Location) ). There will then be an optional pre-meeting workshop from 10-12 on ChIP-seq analysis.  Main arrival, refreshments, and lunch from 12.

* 9.30am Refreshments and registration
* 10-12pm **Optional Workshop**
    * 10-11am **ChIP-seq analysis processes, pipelines and pitfalls (Dr Ian Donaldson; Manchester)**
        An overview of the steps of a basic analysis pipeline with info about how each step is performed by some of the most common tools, and considerations for performing the analyses.
    * 11-12pm **Developing your own peaky blinders (Dr Iros Barozzi; Imperial)**
        Where ChIP-seq data exploration can take you - i.e. from calling peaks to making hypotheses and designing experiments to iterate back with data analysis
* 12-13:00 Registration, **Lunch and posters**
    * Optional **Coding-Clinic**.  Get (or provide) help on coding.
