We are delighted to host the NorthernBUG 7 meeting on Friday, 09th September 2022 at **Norcroft Conference Centre 9 Tumbling Hill St, Bradford BD7 1DB.**. The meeting will start at 12pm with lunch and finish at 5pm, followed by drinks at a local pub. 

Coming to the meeting by public transport is strongly recommended and the conference center is a short walk from both Bradford Foster Square and Interchange rail and bus station.

We're looking for a range of:

* 10 minute talks in: (if you would like to talk for longer please just let us know).
  * Data Visualization and management
  * HPC/software tools
  * Software environment and containerization e.g. (conda). 

* Posters accompanied by a 1-2 minute teaser talk. These are great for those who might be earlier on in their bioinformatics journey!



If anyone would like to fill any of these slots please contact [khaled jumah](mailto:k.jumah@bradford.ac.uk) and please extend the invite around your lab/department etc!
