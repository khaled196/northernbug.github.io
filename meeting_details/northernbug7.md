# General

NorthenBUG returns with its 7th meeting after a COVID-19 holt. Yet, it comes back with strength, appetite and a new way of understanding gatherings.

NorthenBUG7 will be hosted this time as a hybrid event. While in-person attendees will have access to the collaborative nature of this community-led event, talks will also be streamed online, providing Q&A channels for virtual participants.

The meeting will start at 12 pm with lunch, and finish at 5 pm, followed by drinks at a local pub.

# What to expect

NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research. Meetings are free, and the host institution covers costs. We encourage researchers in the early stages of their careers to attend and present their work. It's a great forum to practise your talks, float new ideas and approaches, and present early work.

We welcome research presentations from industry or commercial attendees, sponsorship is also welcome.

## Do you want to present?

  
## Propose a talk

We're looking for enticing 10-minute talks followed by a panel discussion with all presenters. If you have any particular requirements, contact us at. [compdata@bradford.ac.uk](mailto:compdata@bradford.ac.uk)

This year we particularly look forward to topics such as:

    *   Data Visualization and management
    *   HPC/software tools
    *   Software environment and containerization, e.g. conda.

However, if you have any other proposals, we welcome any topics relevant to the NorthenBUG audience. You can view previous topics and agendas on our [meetings page] ([https://northernbug.github.io/meetings/](https://northernbug.github.io/meetings/))

[Talk submission]([https://forms.clickup.com/20526645/f/kjdhn-4468/E0G0ODWGJJSF3L4NEJ](https://forms.clickup.com/20526645/f/kjdhn-4468/E0G0ODWGJJSF3L4NEJ))

  

# Submit a poster abstract

We encourage people presenting posters also to give a 1-minute teaser talk. These are great for those who might not be ready to give a full talk but would like to advertise their topic and get as many people as possible to discuss their poster. Details on the 1-minute teaser talks will be circulated later, but in short, it's 1 minute, 1 slide â€“ and do not try to summarise three years of work, just the 'elevator pitch'.
